## 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports (Medium)

<p>The <code>Employee</code> table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.</p>

<pre>
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
</pre>

<p>Given the <code>Employee</code> table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:
</p>

<pre>
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
No one would report to himself.</p>

### Hints
  1. Try to get all the mangerIDs that have count bigger than 5
  1. Use the last hint's result as a table and do join with origin table at id equals to managerId
  1. This is a very good example to show the performance of SQL code. Try to work out other solutions and you may be surprised by running time difference.
  1. If your solution uses 'IN' function and runs more than 5 seconds, try to optimize it by using 'JOIN' instead.
