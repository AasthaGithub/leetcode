## 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends (Medium)

In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others' requests as well.</p>
Table <code>request_accepted</code> holds the data of friend acceptance, while <b>requester_id</b> and <b>accepter_id</b> both are the id of a person.
</p>
<pre>
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
</pre>
 
Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the sample data above, the result is:
<pre>
| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |
</pre>
 
<b>Note:</b>
<li>It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.</li>
<li>The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same <b>requester_id</b> and <b>accepter_id</b> value.
</p>
 
<b>Explanation:</b></br>
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.</p>
 
<b>Follow-up:</b></br> In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends, can you find all these people in this case?

### Hints
  1. Being friends is bidirectional. If you accept someone's adding friend request, both you and the other person will have one more friend.
