## 608. Tree Node (Medium)

<p>
Given a table <code>tree</code>, <b>id</b> is identifier of the tree node and <b>p_id</b> is its parent node's <b>id</b>.
</p>
 
<pre>
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
</pre>
 
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:</br>
<li>Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.</li>
<li>Root: if the node is the root of the tree.</li>
<li>Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.</li></p>
 
Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:</p>
 
<pre>
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
</pre>
</p>
 
<p>
<b>Explanation</b>
</p>
<p>
<li>Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node '2' and '3'.</li>
<li>Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node '4' and '5'.</li>
<li>Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent node and they don't have child node.</li>
</br>
And here is the image of the sample tree as below:
</p>
<pre>
			  1
			/   \
                      2       3
                    /   \
                  4       5
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note</b>
</p>
<p>
If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
</p>

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
You can judge the node type by querying whether the node's id shows up in p_id column and whether the node's p_id is null.
