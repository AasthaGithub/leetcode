## 76. Minimum Window Substring (Hard)

<p>Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: S</strong> = &quot;ADOBECODEBANC&quot;, <strong>T</strong> = &quot;ABC&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;BANC&quot;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.</li>
	<li>If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.</li>
</ul>
